# SCIP Exercises in Racket

Working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, writing all solutions in Racket (a Scheme dialect).

## Why Racket?

SICP uses Scheme, and Racket is a modern, batteries-included Scheme implementation with excellent tooling and documentation.

## Structure

Each chapter gets its own `.org` file:

- `chapter1.org` - Building Abstractions with Procedures
- `chapter2.org` - Building Abstractions with Data
- `chapter3.org` - Modularity, Objects, and State
- `chapter4.org` - Metalinguistic Abstraction
- `chapter5.org` - Computing with Register Machines

## Running the code

Use `racket` to run Scheme files, or `drracket` for an interactive IDE. In org-mode, evaluate code blocks with `C-c C-c`.
