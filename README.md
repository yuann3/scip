# SCIP Exercises in Elisp

Working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, writing all solutions in Emacs Lisp.

## Why Elisp?

SICP uses Scheme, but Elisp is close enough and I use Emacs daily. Might as well practice in a language I actually use.

## Structure

Each chapter gets its own `.org` file:

- `chapter1.org` - Building Abstractions with Procedures
- `chapter2.org` - Building Abstractions with Data
- `chapter3.org` - Modularity, Objects, and State
- `chapter4.org` - Metalinguistic Abstraction
- `chapter5.org` - Computing with Register Machines

## Running the code

Evaluate code blocks directly in Emacs with `C-c C-c` inside org-mode, or use `M-x ielm` for an interactive Elisp REPL.
